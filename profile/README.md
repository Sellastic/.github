**Point-of-Sales** is a critical part of today's business, It's where the retail transaction is completed. The process has to be smooth and fast to ensure customer satisfaction and it has to be optimized to help the business keep track of its resources.

Point-of-Sales systems are used everywhere for retails and hospitality businesses, from small shops, restaurants, cafes, bars, hospitals, hotels, malls, pharmacies to chain stores and restaurants. Running a business isn't easy, and especially so for retailers, restaurant owners, and others who have a brick-and-mortar storefront. Managing purchases and cash flow, keeping inventory stocked, making sure your employees are happy, and above all else serving your customers needs requires dedication, a solid business plan, and a bit of luck to be successful. However, some of them cost much with a much higher cost for installation, maintenance, and support. That's why we aim and hope to help businesses with the open source free "**Point of Sales**" system.
